            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">4. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              We maintain strict principles regarding information sharing and disclosure. We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes or commercial gain. Your educational data is entrusted to us for the sole purpose of supporting your academic journey and school operations, and we honor that trust by sharing information only in limited, necessary circumstances that directly support educational objectives or legal obligations.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Within our school community, information sharing follows the principle of legitimate educational interest. Teachers and educators receive access to student academic records, attendance data, grades, and assignments for students enrolled in their classes, enabling them to provide effective instruction and meaningful feedback. School administrators access comprehensive data for administrative purposes, analytical work, and reporting responsibilities that support institutional decision-making and improvement. Other students may see limited information that facilitates community building and awareness, such as class rosters that help students identify classmates, electoral candidate information that supports informed voting, hall of fame achievements that celebrate excellence, and gallery photos that document shared experiences. Parents and guardians receive access to their child's complete academic records, attendance history, grades, and all communications with teachers, ensuring they remain full partners in their child's education.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Service providers and partners play essential roles in delivering educational services, and we share information with them under strict contractual protections. Cloud hosting services that provide secure data storage and system infrastructure receive technical data necessary for system operation. E-learning platforms and educational video content delivery services access usage information to provide streaming capabilities and track educational engagement. Entertainment providers that supply licensed streaming content receive viewing preferences to deliver age-appropriate content. Analytics services that monitor system performance and inform improvements process anonymized usage data. Communication services that power email and messaging infrastructure handle message delivery while maintaining security. Payment processors manage secure financial transaction handling for tuition payments through PCI-compliant systems. All service providers are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of your information and may use it only for the specific purposes for which it was shared, never for their own commercial purposes.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Legal and regulatory requirements sometimes necessitate information disclosure beyond our normal practices. We respond to lawful demands when required by statute, regulation, legal process, or government request. Compliance with educational reporting requirements and audits ensures we meet our obligations to education authorities. Court orders, subpoenas, and legal proceedings receive appropriate responses after careful legal review. Law enforcement investigations receive cooperation when legally required and when doing so protects our community. We carefully evaluate each legal request to ensure it is properly authorized and narrowly tailored to legitimate needs.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Safety and protection of our school community may require information sharing in specific circumstances. We disclose information when necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Glorious Schools, our students, staff, or others from harm. Suspected violations of our Terms of Service or school policies trigger investigations that may involve reviewing relevant user data. Security issues, fraud attempts, or technical problems that threaten system integrity prompt information sharing with security experts and law enforcement. Emergency situations where student welfare is at immediate risk override normal privacy constraints, as protecting our students is our highest priority.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              With your explicit consent, we may share information for purposes you specifically authorize. When you explicitly authorize us to share your information with third parties, such as external academic programs or educational competitions, we honor those permissions. Specific purposes you approve through informed consent, such as participation in optional surveys or research studies that may benefit the broader educational community, proceed only with your clear agreement. You retain control over these discretionary sharing decisions and can withdraw consent where legally permissible.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Business transfers represent another limited circumstance where information sharing may occur. In the unlikely event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, student information may be transferred as part of that transaction to ensure continuity of educational services. We commit to notifying affected users of any such change in ownership or control of personal information, providing transparency about who will become responsible for protecting your data. Any successor organization would be bound by the privacy commitments made in this policy unless you consent to changes.
